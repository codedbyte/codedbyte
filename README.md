# Hey there, I’m Derick Rono 👋

I’m a front-end developer who loves turning ideas into beautiful, functional websites. Right now, I’m in my second year studying Software Engineering at Multimedia University of Kenya, and I’m all about learning new skills and building projects that matter.

## A Bit About Me

Coding isn’t just a skill for me — it’s a way to solve problems and bring creativity to life. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and making sure the user’s experience is always smooth and enjoyable. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring design tools like Figma or Canva to sharpen my eye for detail.

## What I’m Good At

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including React)  
- Styling with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap  
- Using npm, Webpack, and Vite to keep projects smooth and organized  
- Designing mockups and prototypes in Figma and Canva  
- Deploying sites on Vercel and Netlify

## What I Can Bring to Your Team

I’m a fast learner who loves a challenge. I’m comfortable working independently or collaborating with a team, always making sure communications are clear and deadlines are met. My goal? To contribute to projects that are not only well-built but also user-friendly and accessible.
